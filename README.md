2.0 Foreword
The next generation HR system OrangeHRM will change the way your company managed a
vital asset of your company. Since 2006 Orange HRM has been researching and working on a
way to produce a cost effective system to re-engineer your HR process. As a result of your
contributions, support and our hard work, we are proud to bring you our latest release 2.5.
With an improved and highly user friendly interface this new version is backed by many
more new features.
The module based architecture has been a key user-friendly feature. The modules are as
follows.
Admin Module
The Admin Module provides you with full control of all settings that affect the action of your
OrangeHRM implementation. Through the Admin Module, you can:
*?Define the company hierarchy, pay grades, projects, memberships, qualifications etc.
*?Add other administrators, and set access levels for each user
*?Handling security issues
*?Data importing and exporting
*?Adding custom fields
The Admin Module is the backbone of the system and setting it up accurately is important for
smooth operation.
PIM – Personal Information Module
This module maintains all relevant employee related information. All information about an
employee can be entered here. Information captured in this module is utilized by all other
modules, thus eliminating data redundancy. The PIM Module will be available to the admin
with full control and supervisors with restricted access showing his subordinates.

ESS - Employee Self Service
A module available to general users allowing them to update vital information like contact
details, education, skills, licenses etc. Certain fields that are defined by the admin cannot be
changed e.g. Job and Salary.
The functionality of this module spans through the entire system, making information
available anywhere, anytime. All information is subject to company defined security
policy, where everyone can only view the information he/she is authorized to.
Leave Module
The Leave Module automates the HR administrative tasks of recording leave and controlling
these against leave policies defined in the HR system. The module provides flexibility in
allowing you to define various types of Leave, including Annual Leave, Sick Leave, Travel
leave etc. The Leave Module has the ability to send notifications to covering officers and
allows you to record, track leave and view leave history.
The web-enabled and self-service concepts significantly streamline all leave related
procedures, eliminate paperwork and saves costs.
Time Module
Business-critical operations require reliable tracking and control in order to maximize profits
and reduce operational costs. A time management tool is one of the vital employee work time
management features that make the entire difference between successful HR-Management
and a weak one.
The Time module automates the time tracking process. While allowing the employee to
define and submit their timesheets the supervisors can approve/reject or even modify them.
The employee will enter the punch in/out time hence allowing attendance monitoring. The
Time module has the ability to track time spent on specific projects while project mangers
can define projects.

promptly.
